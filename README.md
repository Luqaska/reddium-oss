Have you ever wanted to browse Reddit while studying at Starbucks? Or maybe while sitting on the subway to work? In those situations, you might start being self-conscious of Reddit's bright and distinct website. Would people around you judge the subreddits you browse and the posts you read? Now, think about someone browsing Medium in these situations. Just seeing the interface of Medium gives the impression of someone being a "knowledge seeker".

Reddium is a Medium-themed Reddit client. No more worries about being judged while browsing Reddit in public. The Reddium interface converts Reddit posts, discussions, and memes into well-crafted articles. Once remote work is over, Reddium will be the perfect site to visit during your commute.

Built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and hosted on Vercel. Reddium is currently still in development.
